# Tink Go TPM KMS extension

> this library is not supported by google

This is an extension to the [Tink Go](https://github.com/tink-crypto/tink-go) library that provides support for key management with a TPM.

It provides a [KMSClient](https://github.com/tink-crypto/tink-go/blob/main/core/registry/kms_client.go) which uses a TPM to encrypt and decrypt data.
